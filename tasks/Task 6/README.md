# Task 6 -->

Write a JS program that accept an even number (n should be greater than
or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 50000, Goldbach number) from the user
and create a combinations that express the given number as a sum of two prime
numbers. Print the number of combinations.</br>
Goldbach number: A Goldbach number is a positive even integer that can be
expressed as the sum of two odd primes.[4] Since four is the only even number
greater than two that requires the even prime 2 in order to be written as the sum
of two primes, another form of the statement of Goldbach's conjecture is that all
even integers greater than 4 are Goldbach numbers.</br>
The expression of a given even number as a sum of two primes is called a
Goldbach partition of that number. The following are examples of Goldbach
partitions for some even numbers:

6 = 3 + 3</br>
8 = 3 + 5</br>
10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5</br>
12 = 7 + 5</br>
...
</br>
100 = 3 + 97 = 11 + 89 = 17 + 83 = 29 + 71 = 41 + 59 = 47 + 53

## Sample Input:
100 </br>
0

## Sample Output: 
 Number of combinations: 6
